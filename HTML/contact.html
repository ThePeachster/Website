                Hey there!
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm Jason Peacher-Ton! Originally a Seattlite but currently living my life in Austin.
                <br>
                <br>
                My passion for photography began after a trip to Thailand. At the time, I thought they were extremely
                dope photos. They weren't. But I caught the bug, and I couldn't stop looking for compositions. 
                Soon after that, I discovered photographers such as Nick Page and Thomas Heaton, and proceeded to binge 
                all of their content on YouTube. The logical next step was to empty my savings to buy a ticket to Iceland during spring break of college
                and practice on the most photogenic landscape on earth.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since that Iceland trip, I've taken every opportunity to empty my meager college savings and travel. So far, I've traveled to eight
                countries and hoping to add a lot more to that list. My most recent trips took me to 16 National Parks, including Glacier,
                Zion, Mt. Rainier, and Yosemite. I'm now working in a full-time position, which limits my free time but... at least I don't have to
                scrounge for travel money anymore.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you've gotten this far, I appreciate that you've taken the time to check out my work! Nothing makes me happier than having someone
                interact with the photos that I've taken. Someday I would love to make photography a full-time job. But for now, I'll continue to practice
                and improve. If you want to get in touch, shoot me an email! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks again, I hope you enjoy the site!
